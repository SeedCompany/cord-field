# CORD Field

### Connecting to API Server

By default, this project will attempt to access the `cord-api-v3` project that's running locally on your machine.

If you'd like to change the API server that you're connected to: create an `.env.local` file with the following contents:

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://your-api-server-host.com:3000
```
