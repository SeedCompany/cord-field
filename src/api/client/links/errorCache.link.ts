 * This allows to errors to be cached & reused without going to the network.
 * This is mainly for SSR requests so the client doesn't have to refetch them.
 *
 * Note that React will still warn about invalid server HTML, because the
 * useQuery hook will think it is loading it from the network on init.
 * Immediately following however, the error is given to the hook. From my testing,
 * the loading state never gets a chance to render, so this looks seamless
 * from the users perspective.
