/**
 * Creates a query/search param hook with a defined schema.
 *
 * This creates a hook which means the config/schema cannot be changed
 * at runtime but we also don't have to check for that so it's more performant.
 *
 * Multiple hooks can be used at once. The setter only changes the values
 * defined by the hooks schema. The setter itself does not allow partial sets.
 * Basically it works just like `useState`.
 *
 * By default, the setter replaces the current history entry instead of pushing
 * a new one. This default is the opposite of react-router's defaults, but I
 * think it makes more sense here for query parameter handling.
 *
 * @example
 * const useColorState = makeQueryHandler({
 *   name: StringParam,
 *   red: NumberParam,
 *   green: NumberParam,
 *   blue: NumberParam,
 *   favorite: BooleanParam(),
 * });
 * export const MyComponent = () => {
 *   const [color, setColor] = useColorState();
 *   color.name // string | undefined
 *   color.red // number | undefined
 * };
 *
 * Each value of the schema is an object that defines encode & decode functions.
 * This makes it easy to have custom handling and abstract it.
 *
 *
 * This integrates `react-router` v6 with the `serialize-query-params` library.
 * This is essentially what `use-query-params` library does, but it isn't updated
 * for RR v6. RR v6 includes more OOTB in this area so only thin wrapper is needed.
